<p>I'm a Scientific Software Engineer at the <a href="https://nceas.ucsb.edu">National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis</a> working remotely from Juneau, Alaska, USA. Before that, I earned an M.S. in Fisheries from the <a href="https://www.uaf.edu/cfos/">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>. I'm broadly interested in computational topics in the (biological) sciences, especially statistical modeling and data visualization.</p>
