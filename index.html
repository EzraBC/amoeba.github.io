<p>I'm a Master's candidate at the <a href="http://www.uaf.edu">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a> <a href="http://www.sfos.uaf.edu">School of Fisheries and Ocean Sciences</a> in Juneau, Alaska, USA.</p>

<p>My thesis work focuses on predicting upriver migratory timing of Yukon River Chinook salmon (<i>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</i>) using a combination of meteorology, genetics, radiotelemetry, and the inordinate amounts of <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">R</a> code. My work on this topic has developed my interest in how fisheries managers use in-season data to update their expectations about various parameters of the run (e.g. size, timing).</p>

<p>I'm broadly interested in computational aspects in the (biological) sciences. I really like statistics and data visualization.</p>
